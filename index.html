<h1>Ear</h1>

<p>Ear is a general-purpose programming language designed on the principles of
mathematical equivalence. An Ear program is simply a list of equivalent
patterns.</p>

<p>Here is an example of an Ear number implementation:</p>

<pre><code>        num zero     = true
num A | num (succ A) = true
        num X        = false

zero + A     = A + zero
A + zero     = A
A + (succ B) = succ (A + B)

zero * A     = A * zero
A * zero     = zero
A * (succ B) = A + (A * B)
</code></pre>

<p>We  will  be dissecting this example  throughout  this article.</p>

<h2>Elimination</h2>

<pre><code>$ ear
Ear Alpha-xxxxxxx
Ready.
[e] succ zero
 =  succ zero
[e] (succ (succ zero)) * (succ (succ zero))
 =  succ (succ (succ (succ zero)))
[e]
</code></pre>

<p>First, Ear loads. It may take a little while to load, as Alpha is expected to
be slow. You'll see messages like this</p>

<pre><code>Loading 'essential' environment... (5/24)
</code></pre>

<p>followed by the <code>Ready.</code> status in the previous example once Ear has finished
loading.</p>

<p>The <code>[e]</code> prompt shows that we are in <code>elimination</code> mode, that is, Ear will
attempt to find the equivalent form of what you entered which uses the least
patterns. for example, <code>(succ zero) * (succ zero)</code> involves 3 patterns
(<code>_ * _</code>, <code>succ _</code> and <code>zero</code>), where an equivalent form of it, <code>succ zero</code>,
only involves 2 patterns (<code>succ _</code> and <code>zero</code>).</p>

<p>So, back to the first entry.</p>

<pre><code>[e] succ zero
 =  succ zero
</code></pre>

<p>The form of <code>succ zero</code> with the least number of patterns is <code>succ zero</code>. That
is, Ear has found that <code>succ zero</code> already contains the least number of
patterns possible (at least, thus far).</p>

<pre><code>[e] (succ (succ zero)) * (succ (succ zero))
 =  succ (succ (succ (succ zero)))
</code></pre>

<p>This is the same thing discussed above. What we entered contains 7 entities in
3 patterns, and the result Ear found has 5 entities in 2 patterns. In the
<code>elimination</code> strategy, it is the number of patterns that count; that's how it
found the answer.</p>

<p>Moving on, consider the following:</p>

<pre><code>[e] one = succ zero
[e] succ zero
 =  one
[e] one
 =  one
[e] one + one
 =  succ one
 =  one + one
 =  succ (succ zero)
</code></pre>

<p>Uh-oh. Ear has found that <code>succ one</code> and <code>succ (succ zero)</code> both have the same
number of entities, and both are equivalent to <code>one + one</code>. Can something have
three right answers? Yes, if the answers are equivalent.
<code>one + one = succ one = succ (succ zero)</code>. They're just different ways of
expressing the same thing.</p>

<p>For convenience, Ear has sorted the three answers by number of entities and
complexity of syntax. What happens, now, if we do this?</p>

<pre><code>[e] two = succ one
[e] two + two
 =  two + two
 =  succ (succ two)
 =  succ (succ (succ one))
 =  succ (succ (succ (succ zero)))
</code></pre>

<p>Whoa. That's more than we need...</p>

<h2>Elimination and Expansion</h2>

<p><code>E</code> mode takes an extra step. After eliminating unneeded patterns, it returns
the result(s) with the highest number of entities. This is, in most cases,
what you expect in the first place; for example:</p>

<pre><code>[E] two + two
 =  succ (succ (succ (succ zero)))
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Warning!</strong> There probably <em>are</em> some cases where <code>E</code> mode's output is
confusing. In these cases, don't cry, revert to <code>e</code>. It should give you what
you're looking for.</p>
